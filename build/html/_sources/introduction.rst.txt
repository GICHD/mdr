Introduction
============

The GICHD has initiated a process to define a set of minimum data requirements for mine action that will be submitted as a proposal for a TNMA and will eventually accompany IMSMA Core.

We are developing the minimum data requirements to ensure that the data necessary to generate information that fulfill requirements resulting from standards and conventions is available from all mine action programs. A draft set of data requirements have been developed based on the requirements of APMBC, CCM and IMAS together with certain donors and operators global reporting requirements.  
 
The draft version of the minimum data requirements is listed here and the final set of minimum data requirements will together with definitions for the terms, used to fill each field of data form our proposal for a new TNMA.
